Software Initial Requirements


For this project, I will be focusing on creating the internal structure for the navigation
from existing professors to existing feedback threads and the creation of new feeds and sections.

User Requirements

● There must be a searching method for finding a professor
● There must be a list of classes each professor teaches and you must be able to add classes
if they are not already listed
● Within each class there must be a list of topics the user can choose from and the user
should be able to add a topic
● Once in a topic there must be a list of feeds and the user must be able to add new feeds
● With in the feeds there must be an option to comment and reply to comments

Systems Requirements

● Once the user has selected a professor, they will have a series of classes that they can
choose from with a plus tab at the bottom that they can click to add another class
● If there are no classes that have been created already for that professor then there will
only be a plus tab
● Once you click the plus tab there will be a space where you can you can type the name of
the class and add it to the system
● The user will not be allowed to add if they have not written anything
● With in the class section there will be the same format as with the professor section but
instead of classes to choose from there will be topics
● Once the topic has been chosen/created there are feeds, to choose from, again with the
same format as classes and professors
● In a feed, users can comment or reply to comments
● There will be a text box at the top of the page that students can write in and click post in
order to add to the discussion
● User can reply to a comment by pushing a reply button on an existing comment and
writing in a text box

Non-Functional Requirements

● A time efficient navigation system will be optimized for
● We will have limited time to create this website so we aim to keep it as simple as possible
● We hope to keep the website centered on both creating an improvement mindset for
teaching and anonymous feedback
