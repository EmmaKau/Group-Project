User Requirements: 
I will oversee the homepage for this project. The homepage will consist of a brief introduction to our program, a search bar for the user to search for a professor, a place to add a new professor to the system, and a place to give our program feedback. Some constraints the user will have in the program is that the search bar will be limited to searching for a professor. Our program is also going to implemented specifically for students at the University of Puget Sound. The idea behind our process is that the user will search for a professor and from there choose their class and section to upload the feedback. If the user searches a professor and there is no one that matches that name the program will give an option for the user to add a new professor. The user will also want a place to give feedback to our program, so we can update the program to better fit their needs.

System Requirements:
Once you reach our program you will need to search through the database and find the specific professor the user is looking for, this is a functional requirement. The program will need to go to the information we have about the professor (to offer feedback about the class). My part of the program requires navigating to the professorâ€™s page. The next requirement is having an option for the user to add a new professor to the database. If the user searches for a professor and they are not already in the database, we want the system to have an option for the user to be able to add their professor, the class and section into the database, this is also a functional requirement. The last system requirement for my program is the option for the user to add feedback about our program. This will be a feed at the bottom of the page for people to write and upload comments into the feed about the program and what could be improved, this is also a functional requirement.
